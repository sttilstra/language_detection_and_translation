# language_detection_and_translation
These scripts were part of a proof of concept project for a multilingual chatbot which I created using Azure Bot Composer. Both scripts reach out to Azure AI resources which determine the language of a given statement and also perform a translation to a target language. There is also a function which reaches out to a joke api using a basic http request in case the user requests to hear a joke.
These scripts were published as azure functions and called via HTTP request which I used as an action in the bot!
